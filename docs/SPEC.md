# EXSQS — Specification v1.3 (2026-04-28) — v1.0 frozen 2026-02-16; changes tracked in §16

Supersedes the v0.1 draft (`SPEC_step0.md`). All Step-0 blocking decisions are resolved (§14);
Step 0 is complete. Changes vs draft: Q1→[A15], Q2→[A16], Q3→§1 scope; new test T-C4.

Reference algorithm: A. P. Kądzielawa, *On generating Special Quasirandom Structures: Optimization
for the DFT computational efficiency*, arXiv:2602.10872 (2026). Alg. 1 (extinction workflow),
Alg. 2 (error function).

Tags used below:
- **[A#]** — adopted convention (binding for v1)
- **[D#]** — documented deviation from / disambiguation of the paper's pseudocode

---

## 1. Scope of v1

In scope:
- Single active sublattice: prototypes whose decorated sites form one Wyckoff orbit
  (sc, bcc, fcc, hcp built-in; arbitrary POSCAR/CIF prototype accepted if its sites are one orbit).
- **K-component data model from day one; v1 *validated* scope is binary (K = 2).** K-ary code
  paths are compiled and unit-tested but flagged `experimental` at runtime until the K-ary
  validation pass (v1.1). *(Q3 resolution.)*
- Fixed supercell per run: diagonal `n1×n2×n3` or full 3×3 integer matrix H (shape *scan* = outer
  loop over configs, embarrassingly parallel; shape *optimization* is out of scope).
- Pair correlations by coordination zone (paper-faithful). Triplets/CE clusters: out of scope v1.
- Objective = correlation error × displacement-count penalty; pure-SQS mode via `gamma: 0`.

Out of scope v1: multi-sublattice decoration, GPU, on-the-fly cell-shape search, cluster orders > 2,
relaxed/strained geometries (ideal lattice positions only).

## 2. Notation and data model

- Prototype lattice cell `A0` (3×3, columns = vectors), basis sites; supercell `A = A0·H`,
  `N = m·n_basis` sites at ideal fractional coordinates `f_i` (exact rationals by construction).
- Species set `T = {t_1..t_K}`; decoration `σ: {1..N} → T`; counts `N_t`, achieved concentrations
  `x̃_t = N_t/N` (§9).
- Background `B`: the 27 periodic copies of the supercell, offsets `(i,j,k) ∈ {−1,0,1}³` (Alg. 2:2–7).
  Ordered pairs `(i ∈ S, j ∈ B)` with `d_ij > 0` — i.e., the zero-distance self pair is excluded,
  but nonzero self-images **are** legitimate PBC neighbors and are included. **[A1]**
- `D(σ)`: number of irreducible finite-displacement calculations for the phonon run (§6).

## 3. Geometry: coordination zones

- Zones are a property of the **undecorated** geometry: sorted pair distances of `(S,B)` merged into
  shells with tolerance `ε_shell` (relative, default `1e-3`); shell n has radius `R_n` and per-site
  count `Z_n` (constant across sites because active sites are one orbit — v1 scope guard). **[A2]**
- Pair→zone lookup precomputed **once per (lattice, H, n_shells)** and shared by all evaluations;
  stored as per-site neighbor lists up to shell `n_max` (not the full 27N² table).
- `n_max` default 7. If `R_{n_max}` exceeds half the minimal supercell width, emit a warning
  (correlations there are constrained by self-images — allowed, but user should know). **[A3]**
- Sanity identities: `Σ_i (neighbors of i in shell n) = N·Z_n`; bcc coordination sequence
  8, 6, 12, 24, 8; fcc 12, 6, 24, 12, 24 (used in tests, §12).

## 4. Correlation and error function

Counters over ordered pairs within shells `n = 1..n_max`, for center type `t`, neighbor type `t'`:

```
C_{t,t'}(n) = #{ (i,j) : σ_i = t, σ_j = t', zone(i,j) = n }
P_t(n)      = Σ_{t'} C_{t,t'}(n)                     # pairs whose central atom is type t
Π_{t,t'}(n) = C_{t,t'}(n) / P_t(n)                   # P(neighbor is t' | center is t), Σ_{t'} Π = 1
```

**[D1]** Alg. 2:19 `population` is read as `P_t(n)` above (pairs whose *central* atom is type t).
Justification: only then does the random limit give `Π_{t,t}(n) → x_t`, which is what line 20
compares against. Normalizing by all pairs would give `x_t²` and never converge to `x_t`.

**[D2]** Alg. 2:20 `correlation = x[atomType]` is read as `-=` (subtraction). The error term is the
absolute deviation from the random limit.

**[A16] Error modes** *(Q2 resolution)* — config `error.mode: auto | diagonal | full_pairs`,
default `auto` = `diagonal` for K = 2, `full_pairs` for K ≥ 3:

```
diagonal   (paper-faithful):  E_pure = Σ_n A_n Σ_t     | Π_{t,t}(n)  − x̃_t  |
full_pairs (K ≥ 3 default):   E_pure = Σ_n A_n Σ_{t,t'} | Π_{t,t'}(n) − x̃_t' |
E_obj = E_pure · D^γ                                  # γ = 1 default; γ = 0 → pure-SQS mode
```

- Rationale: for K = 2 the off-diagonal deviations are fully determined by the diagonal ones; for
  K ≥ 3 diagonal-only under-constrains the SRO matrix.
- Exact identities (used as tests): `C_{t,t'}(n) = C_{t',t}(n)` (ordered-pair bijection), and for
  **K = 2: `E_full ≡ 2·E_diag` for every decoration** — mode choice never changes rankings for
  binaries, only the scale. Consequence: `e_tol` is interpreted in the *active* mode's scale;
  logs always report both `E_diag` and `E_full` for K = 2.
- Weights `A_n`: `1/n` default; options `n^{−p}`, `R_n^{−1}`, explicit list (paper tested these;
  `1/n` converged best for cheap supercells). **[A4]**
- **[D3]** Exponent γ generalizes Alg. 2:22 (`γ=1` reproduces the paper; `γ=0` gives an
  ATAT/sqsgenerator-comparable pure error for benchmarking).
- Interpretation (documentation + validator): `|Π_{t,t}(n) − x̃_t| = x̃_t·|α_tt(n)|` with the diagonal
  Warren–Cowley parameter `α_tt(n) = 1 − Π_{t,t}(n)/x̃_t`. So E_pure is a weighted sum of
  concentration-scaled |WC SRO| values.
- Targets are the **achieved** concentrations `x̃_t`, not the requested ones (§9). **[A5]**
- Note for tests: a random *canonical* decoration has `E[Π_{t,t}(n)] = (N_t−1)/(N−1)`, not `x̃_t`
  (hypergeometric, offset `(1−x̃_t)/(N−1)`); the statistical test (§12, T-C3) must expect this.

### 4.1 Quantization floor E_floor (v1.1)

`C` counters are integers while `P_t(n) = N_t·Z_n` is fixed by composition and geometry, so every
error term is bounded below: `|Π_{t,t'}(n) − x̃_{t'}| ≥ dist(x̃_{t'}·P_t(n), ℤ)/P_t(n)`. Summing the
independent per-term minima gives a computable lower bound on E_pure:

```
E_floor = Σ_n A_n Σ_t dist(x̃_t·P_t(n), ℤ) / P_t(n)     # diagonal; full_pairs sums t' too
                                                        # (K = 2: exactly 2×E_floor_diag)
```

Reference system W₉₀Cr₃₈ / bcc 4×4×4 / 7 shells / A_n = 1/n: `E_floor = 3.246e-3`. The engine
computes and logs E_floor at startup and warns when the requested `e_tol` lies below it
(infeasible; the run then terminates on caps only). For *commensurate* compositions every
`x̃_t·P_t(n)` can be integral and `E_floor = 0` exactly (e.g. W₆₄Mo₃₂Cr₃₂ on bcc 4×4×4, v1.4):
the bound is then uninformative and `e_tol: auto` degenerates to 0 — set a numeric tolerance.

**Scale caveat (v1.1):** the paper's reported absolute errors (Fig. 1: 𝔈 = 2.01–2.92·10⁻⁴ for this
very system) lie *below* this provable bound, so the paper's reported scalar carries an unstated
normalization. Absolute 𝔈 values are not comparable across codes; comparisons must recompute the
error on raw structures (the T-V1 route). v1.0's absolute defaults (`e_tol: 3e-4`, T-E1's `1e-3`),
inherited from the paper's scale, were infeasible and are replaced by floor-relative values
(§11, §12).

## 5. Symmetry and filtration

- Backend: spglib on ideal decorated cells (positions exact ⇒ tolerance-robust);
  `symprec` default `1e-5` Å, logged. **[A6]**
- Filter policy (Alg. 1:4, 1:21), configurable: default `reject_p1` = reject iff space-group
  number 1 (P1). Options: `min_sg_index N`, explicit whitelist, `min_pointgroup_order N`. **[A7]**
- P1-elite quota `q ≥ 0` (paper's "small ≪ P best P1 structures" variant); default `q = 0`. **[A8]**
- Every emitted structure records: SG number + international symbol, symprec used, point-group order,
  number of inequivalent sites.

## 6. Displacement count D

- **[A15] Pinned convention** *(Q1 resolution)*: `D(σ)` := the number of displaced supercells
  phonopy generates for σ used *directly as the phonon supercell* (`supercell_matrix = 1`) with
  **default settings** (`is_diagonal = True`, `is_plusminus = 'auto'`). Displacement distance is
  irrelevant to the count. Any alternative convention in the future is a *new* enum value of
  `displacements.convention`, never a redefinition of `phonopy_default`.
- Implementation: native C++ from the spglib symmetry dataset — inequivalent atoms
  (`equivalent_atoms`) → site-symmetry group per representative → minimal direction set per
  phonopy's reduction, ± doubling when site symmetry cannot reverse the displacement.
- **Hard validation gate:** exact match against `phonopy` on the full test set (§12, T-D1) before
  the optimizer is trusted.
- Reference magnitudes: P1, 128 atoms ⇒ 6·128 = 768 displacements (identity site symmetry, ±, 3 dirs);
  the paper's C2/Amm2-class cells reach ~5× fewer than P1 ATAT cells.

## 7. Uniqueness and canonical form

- Two decorations are duplicates iff related by a symmetry operation of the **undecorated**
  supercell (lattice translations of H-cell × point ops of the empty supercell), acting on site
  indices. **[A9]**
- Canonical form: precompute the permutation group Π of the undecorated supercell once (from
  spglib on the empty cell); canonical label = lexicographic minimum of `π(σ)` over `π ∈ Π`;
  dedup via 128-bit hash of the canonical label, hash set per island + merge at output. Cost is
  `O(|Π|·N)` per new structure — acceptable at these sizes; a cheap invariant pre-filter
  (composition + per-shell `C_{t,t'}(n)` vector) short-circuits most comparisons. **[A10]**
- Rare hash collisions: accepted risk (verify by full compare on collision).

## 8. Evolutionary operators and termination

- **Seeding** (`rejection | constructive | mixed`, default `mixed`): **[D4]**
  - *rejection* (paper-faithful): uniform random canonical decorations, keep non-P1 & unique.
  - *constructive*: pick a target space group G from a pool of subgroups of the empty supercell's
    group; partition sites into G-orbits; assign species to whole orbits so that composition is met
    (subset-sum over orbit sizes, DP solver); guarantees symmetry ⇒ immune to the
    rejection-collapse failure mode at large N.
- **Evaluation**: `E_obj` for every population member (embarrassingly parallel).
- **Extinction** (Alg. 1:14–17): survival probability `E_min/E_i` (`ratio`, default) or
  `min(1, exp(−β(E_i − E_min)))` (`metropolis`). β: fixed value or `auto` =
  `ln 2 / median(E_i − E_min)` recomputed each generation (median structure survives 50%);
  optional geometric schedule. **[A11]**
- **[D5]** The current best-by-`E_obj` always survives (`elitism_best = 1`) ⇒ `E_min` monotone.
  (Paper does not state this; without it the stochastic extinction can lose the optimum.)
- **Repopulation**: parent = uniform random survivor; mutation = `k` composition-preserving swaps
  of unlike-species site pairs (`k = 1` default; option `k ~ 1 + Poisson(λ)`); accept offspring iff
  passes filter + unique; retry budget per slot (default 100), then fall back to constructive
  seeding for that slot. **[A12]**
  - Optional `symmetry_preserving: true`: swap species assignments between equal-size orbits of a
    subgroup H of the parent's group (keeps H by construction; avoids the
    mutate→P1→reject loop). Recommended default `true`, with plain swaps as fallback. **[D6]**
- **Termination [D7]:** disambiguation of Alg. 1:9–12 (E "includes displacements", success tests
  `E_min/D_min`): selection pressure uses `E_obj`; success is declared when
  `min_i E_pure(σ_i) ≤ E_tol` (the tolerance certifies "is a proper SQS"; D only steers selection).
  Additional caps: `max_generations`, wall-time budget → checkpoint + best-effort output. **[A13]**
  v1.1 adds a *stagnation stop*: if repopulation degenerates to all-fallback seeding
  (`fb ≥ vacancies`) for `stagnation_stop` consecutive generations (default 3), the island
  stops with reason `stagnation`.
- **Output set [D8]:** Alg. 1:2's outer loop is realized as: each island evolves a population of
  size P; the M outputs are the best M *pairwise-inequivalent* structures pooled across
  islands/restarts, ranked by `E_obj` (report `E_pure`, `D`, SG for each).

### 8.1 Parallel execution model (v1.2)

- **Lockstep islands:** all active islands advance one generation per round; a stopped island
  (success/caps/stagnation) freezes and no longer participates. `max_wall_s` and the logged
  `elapsed_s` measure *global run* wall time in this model.
- **Synchronous ring migration** among the still-active islands every `migration_every` rounds:
  island *i* sends copies of its `migrants` pool-best individuals to the next active island
  (ascending-index ring). Receivers skip canonicals already in their archive; otherwise the
  migrant is archived and replaces the receiver's current worst member (the [D5] elite is never
  the worst for P ≥ 2, so `E_min` stays monotone). Exchanges are computed from pre-round
  snapshots and use no RNG — fully deterministic.
- **Round-based generations:** within seeding and repopulation, candidate generation +
  canonicalization and per-candidate evaluation (spglib, D, E) run in parallel; the duplicate
  check with *provisional* archive insert and the quota commit run serially in slot order.
  Provisional insertion is outcome-independent (v1.1 archived admitted and P1-rejected candidates
  alike), so with the default `p1_elite_quota: 0` and no post-seed P1 admissions the rounds are
  bit-equivalent to the v1.1 sequential loop. A P1-rejected slot resumes its own attempt stream
  next round (normative semantics for the rare quota/P1 cases).
- **Thread budget:** `omp_threads` (auto = OpenMP default) split as outer = min(islands, T) over
  islands, inner = T/outer inside each island's evaluation rounds. **Thread counts never change
  results** ([A14]) — verified bitwise for 1 vs 4 threads (T-P1) and against v1.1 sequential run
  artifacts.

### 8.2 Checkpoint/restart and distributed execution (v1.3)

**State files.** The driver writes `state.ckpt` (atomic tmp+rename) into the output directory at
every `checkpoint_every` round and at run end. The file carries a format version and a
*trajectory signature* — every config field that influences the trajectory (system, composition,
zones, error model, evolution dynamics, seed, islands, migration). `--resume DIR` restores the
complete engine state (population, archive, pool, log, counters) bit-exactly; a signature
mismatch is refused, so only budget caps (`max_generations`, `max_wall_s`) and output/threading
fields may change between segments. Islands stopped on a raisable cap re-arm on resume; `e_tol`
success and `stagnation` stops are terminal. Chained segments are bit-identical to an
uninterrupted run (T-K1), including across migration rounds.

**MPI ranks (`exsqs_mpi`).** Islands are distributed round-robin (island *i* → rank *i* mod *R*)
and advance in the same lockstep rounds; activity flags and §8.1 migration payloads travel as
little-endian byte records over collectives, and rank 0 writes the identical `state.ckpt` and
pooled outputs. Because trajectories are island-keyed [A14] and the exchange protocol is
deterministic, **results are bit-identical to the single-process driver for any rank count**
(T-MPI1); serial and MPI state files are interchangeable, so a run may move between 1 and N
nodes across segments. Homogeneous little-endian clusters are assumed (guarded at every
file/wire boundary). Wall-capped stops remain wall-clock-dependent and are excluded from
bit-exactness claims, as in v1.2.

## 9. Composition handling

- `N_t = round(x_t·N)` by largest-remainder so `Σ N_t = N`; achieved `x̃_t` logged and used as the
  correlation target **[A5]**. Hard error if `|x̃_t − x_t| > comp_tol` (default 0.02).
- Consistency check vs paper: 70:30 on 128 sites → W₉₀Cr₃₈ (x̃ = 0.7031/0.2969) — matches the
  paper's stated supercell.
- Constructive seeding feasibility: composition must be a subset-sum of orbit sizes for the chosen
  G; infeasible G are skipped (logged).

## 10. RNG and reproducibility

- Counter-based generator (Philox/PCG) keyed by `(master_seed, island, generation, slot, purpose)`
  ⇒ trajectories are independent of thread count and scheduling; bit-identical reruns from the same
  config+seed. **[A14]**
- v1.2 realizes the thread-invariance guarantee end-to-end (verified bitwise for 1 vs 4 threads
  and against v1.1 sequential artifacts); wall-time semantics are global in the lockstep model.
- `summary.json` records: config echo, achieved composition, seeds, git commit, spglib/phonopy
  versions, timings.

## 13. Deviations from the paper (summary)

D1 normalizer = pairs with central atom of type t; D2 line 20 is `-=`; D3 γ-exponent
generalization of the ×D penalty; D4 constructive (subgroup-orbit) seeding added alongside
rejection; D5 best-structure elitism added; D6 symmetry-preserving mutation added; D7 termination
= `min E_pure ≤ E_tol` with selection on `E_obj`, plus generation/wall-time caps; D8 outer loop
realized as island pooling of M unique outputs.

Each deviation is either paper-faithful under a config switch or strictly additive; defaults are
chosen to reproduce the paper's setup where the pseudocode is unambiguous.

## 15. Status and handoff to Step 1

Step-0 exit criteria **met** (Q1–Q3 answered; A/D items accepted). This document is the binding
reference; changes from here require a version bump and a changelog entry.

Steps 0–1 are realized by the released 1.0.0 core library and its suites (`v1.0.0` tag,
`feat/tests-core`): the CMake ≥ 3.20 + FetchContent skeleton, T-G1/T-G2, T-C1–T-C4, T-S1/T-S2
and the T-D1 phonopy gate, over `lattice` → `structure` → `zones` → `correlation` → `symmetry`
→ `displacements` → `dedup`. Step 2 (the full §8 engine) proceeds tests-first from there.

    ranks" is now runnable). Serial and MPI state files are interchangeable.
  - New binary encoding (`serialize.hpp`): little-endian, IEEE-754 bit patterns; homogeneous
    little-endian clusters assumed and guarded. Engine exposed via `EngineHandle`
    (island_engine.hpp) for external drivers and tests.
  - CLI `--resume DIR`; SLURM templates (`scripts/slurm/`) and a resubmission-chain pattern
    (`scripts/chain_resume.sh`) keyed to the 0/3 exit-code contract.
  - New tests T-K1/T-K2/T-MPI1. Mid-run `checkpoint.json` snapshots are not written under MPI
    (state.ckpt supersedes them there); per-generation stdout rows come from rank 0's islands.
- **v1.2 (2026-03-31)** — step-3 parallel layer:
  - §8.1: lockstep islands, synchronous ring migration (defined; previously only schema keys), and
    round-based generations with provisional archive inserts; bit-equivalent to v1.1 for the
    default quota and empirically preserved on all reference runs (verified against 1.1.0
    artifacts to the last bit, including under `omp_threads: 4`).
  - `parallel.omp_threads` active; nested outer(islands)×inner(evaluation) OpenMP; exceptions
    captured per island and rethrown deterministically; checkpoint callback serialized.
  - `summary.json` gains `island_migrants_in/out`. `max_wall_s`/`elapsed_s` are global run wall
    time. New tests T-P0/T-P1/T-M1; engine refactored into a resumable IslandEngine (the
    checkpoint/restart foundation for step 4). MPI multi-node island scaling ("ranks" in T-B1)
    is deferred to the HPC step; `exsqs_bench_scaling` records single-node numbers.
- **v1.1 (2026-03-10)** — step-2 integration findings:
  - §4.1: quantization floor `E_floor` defined, computed and logged; **the paper's absolute error
    scale is not reproducible from Alg. 2** (reported 2.92e-4 < floor 3.246e-3 for its own
    reference system) — cross-code comparisons go via raw structures only (T-V1).
  - §11: `e_tol: auto` (= 3.0×E_floor) is the new default; numeric values below E_floor trigger an
    infeasibility warning. §12 T-E1/T-E2 acceptance re-pinned floor-relative.
  - [A12]: Poisson swap-count option implemented (`swaps: poisson`, `lambda`; k ~ 1+Poisson(λ)).
  - [A13]: stagnation early-stop (all-fallback repopulation × `stagnation_stop` generations).
  - [D6] refined: H = cyclic ⟨g⟩ of one randomly chosen nontrivial parent op per move, replacing
    the full-stabilizer variant, which ratchets symmetry monotonically upward and traps the search
    in high-symmetry strata (empirical stall at ~5× floor; see STEP2_REPORT).
  - Empirical serial reference (seed 42): 4 islands × metropolis β=3000 reach 2.50×E_floor
    (E_pure = 8.11e-3, SG 8/Cm) on W₉₀Cr₃₈; the productive island crossed the gate at gen 10.
- **v1.0 (2026-02-16)** — frozen after step-0 sign-off (§14).
